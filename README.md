## FinRev

An easy-to-use financial application for managing your income and expenses. Track your finances, add income and expense records, and analyze data using beautiful charts. A simple and effective way to control your budget and manage your finances.

### Unified entry form

FinRev now uses a single `EntryForm` component for both income and expense records. Choose the type of entry, select a category, and enter the amount â€“ the form handles the rest.

### API endpoints

The client communicates with a backend service to persist data. The service exposes the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/entries?type=income` | List income entries |
| `GET` | `/api/entries?type=expense` | List expense entries |
| `POST` | `/api/entries` | Create a new income or expense entry (`{ type, category, amount }`) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/entries/:id` | Remove an entry |
